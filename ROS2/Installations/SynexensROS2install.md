This file is for instructions to start using the Synexens CS20 Solid State ToF Camera in ROS2 environment.
The system I had used is Arm8 -RPi 4 model B (8GB) running Ubuntu 22.04 Focal Release with ROS2 Humble.

All official drivers, demos and sdk available at: https://support.tofsensors.com/resource/sdk/ros2.html
